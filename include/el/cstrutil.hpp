     * the length of the output string. This is a full C implementation of

     * 
     * Characters are copied until the null terminator of _src is reached
     * or the number of characters copied is _n-1. In any case, a null terminator
     * is added to the destination string, except for when the destination buffer
     * size _n is zero, in which case _dest is not modified.
     * 
     * @tparam _CT the character type. Typically char, but any other integral type (e.g. wchar) is also supported.
     * @param _dest pointer to the destination buffer to store the string
     * @param _src pointer to a null-terminated source string.
     * @param _n size of the _dest buffer, including the space for the null terminator.
     * @return size_t the string length (not including the null terminator)
     * of the destination string after copy (equivalent to strlen(_dest)). 
     * This will be at most _n-1 (because the null termination byte is always 
     * added) or strlen(_src), whichever is greater.
