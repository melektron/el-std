     * can be transmitted and/or received from/to the other communication party.
     * It is also responsible for defining the data structure and type associated
     * with each of those interactions.
     * 
     * Both clients and server have to define the link in order to be
     * able to communicate. Ideally, the client and server links would match up
     * meaning that for every e.g. event one party can send, the other party knows of
     * and can receive this event.
     * 
     * If a link receives any interaction from the other party that it either doesn't
     * known of, cannot decode or otherwise interpret, an error is automatically
     * reported to the sending party so a language-dependent error handling scheme such
     * as an exception can catch it.
