Preprocessor definitions for detecting C++ verisons
and enabeling supported features.

Currentyl this might not work for all compilers and it might not work at all.
In order to bypass all version checking, just 
#define __EL_ENABLE_CXX11
#define __EL_ENABLE_CXX17
to enable library features for versions not detected using the __cplusplus definition.
